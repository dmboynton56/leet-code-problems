Problem: Decode Ways
A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> "1", 'B' -> "2", ..., 'Z' -> "26"

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse 
of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:
"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Example 3:
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").

        # my initial thoughts are is that I'm seeing a few keywords that highlight algorithms/data structures in my mind. 
        # grouping brings my mind to defaultdicts (grouping, counting, uniqueness buckets)
        # how it works in my mind is like any number up to 26 is a valid letter, so any number 7-9 has to be by itself
        # for any subset of numbers with only digits 0-6, they could either be by themselves, or together if the first digit is 1 or 2
